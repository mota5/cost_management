# If you are using derby, hsqldb, h2 or mssql with one of the ActiveRecord
# JDBC adapters, configure your database setting as the example below:
#
#development:
#  adapter: mssql
#  username: <username>
#  password: <password>
#  hostname: localhost
#  database: dummy

# If you are using oracle, db2, sybase, informix or prefer to use the plain
# JDBC adapter, configure your database setting as the example below (requires
# you to download and manually install the database vendor's JDBC driver .jar
# file). See your driver documentation for the apropriate driver class and
# connection string:
#
#development:
#  adapter: jdbc
#  username: <username>
#  password: <password>
#  driver: com.ibm.db2.jcc.DB2Driver
#  url: jdbc:db2://localhost:5021/dummy

# MySQL.  Versions 4.1 and 5.0 are recommended.
#
# Install the MySQL driver:
#   gem install mysql
#
# And be sure to use new-style password hashing:
#   http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/old-client.html
development:
      host: localhost
      adapter: jdbc
      driver: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
      url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/kosu_development
      username: kosu_user
      password: kosu_passwd

# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.
